# PeekHeart


Our country India though is on the trajectory of becoming a developed country, it still falls behind in the healthcare infrastructure. Our app Peek Heart is one small step in delivering quality healthcare requirements for the citizens of this country.

We aim to provide free ECG tests and other basic requirements like pill reminder, online health check-ups, find nearby hospitals and much more to cater to all the people, especially the underprivileged people in our society. The test costs 400 to 500 INR which some might not think is much but there are millions in this country who donâ€™t even earn a few hundred/day. Thus creating real life impact in their lives and helping them from falling in the debt trap due to medical bills. We also have an SOS feature (highlighted in Red) through which if a person feels uneasy, he/she can just press the SOS button and an emergency call will be sent to previously saved contacts.

The python code which we used is uploaded in the Python Code folder.

The making of the app is still in progress. The current updated code is uploaded in the Master Branch
